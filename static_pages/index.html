               <p>It’s my 3rd day using this app and I love it already; an insurance company deducted money twice from my account; I was not aware of it and the app could pick that up for me so I was able to get my money and the app could pick that up for me so I was to get my money back; thank you very much.</p>

               <p>Thanks to 22seven I’m debt free</p>
               <p>Yay!! When I made a decision 6 months ago to turn my financial life around, I started doing research and came across 22seven. You’ve certainly made sticking to that decision a lot easier. Today I’m debt free. From a debt of R40 000 6 months ago… may you keep nudging me as I move from debt to building an emergency fund and eventually growing my wealth through savings and investments.</p>

               <p>The best app I have used in 2018</p>
               <p>This is by far the best app I have used in 2018. Why did it take me so long to get it?!
                  It helps me keep track of all my spending- to the cent. I am more aware of my spending habits as all my accounts are linked to the app. If you need budgeting tools and a reality check about your spending, this is the best app for you. If you have a goal you are saving towards, this is for you - as the app tells you how much you need to save per month to reach your goal. It’s WONDERFULL!!!!!</p>

            <h3>Link your accounts</h3>
            <p>The first thing you’ll do is link your money stuff: cheque and savings accounts, credit and store cards, investments, loans and rewards.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <div>2</div>
            <h3>We gather your transactions</h3>
            <p>When you link accounts, 22seven usually gets the last 3 months’ transactions from them. After that, they’re automatically updated whenever you log in, or daily</p>

            <div>3</div>
            <h3>…and sort them for you</h3>
            <p>22seven identifies each transaction and automatically puts it into a category like Groceries, Rent or Pets. Use existing categories or create your own.</p>

            <div>4</div>
            <h3>See where your money goes</h3>
            <p>We automatically add up what you spend on each category, each month, so you see exactly where your money goes. Brace yourself: it’s honest about what you do with your money.</p>
