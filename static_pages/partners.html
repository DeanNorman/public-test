    <br>
        With TaxTim, completing your tax return is as easy as answering a few questions. And, as a 22seven customer, you get a 25% discount off the already affordable price.<br><br> 

But first, here are a few of our favourite reasons to use TaxTim:<br></br><br>

<b>You’ll have a new tax buddy.</b><br><br>

And your new tax buddy, Tim, knows all the right tax-related questions to ask. He’ll guide you through your income and expenses with ease by asking you simple questions in plain English.<br><br><br>

<b>Find new deductions.</b><br><br>

Deductions help reduce your overall tax liability, which means you’re more likely to receive a refund. TaxTim will make sure you claim for all deductions available to you based on your personal tax profile.<br><br><br>

<b>Automatically file returns.</b><br><br>


Thanks to a direct integration with SARS eFiling, your IRP5 data can be imported into TaxTim and your completed return is automatically filed at the touch of a button. No more blue blocked forms for you!<br><br><br>
